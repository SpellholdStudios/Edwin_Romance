## Introduction

Question: So, what's this all about, anyway?

Answer: It is a Weidu mod for Baldur's Gate, Shadows of Amn, that allows the player to carry out a romantic relationship with Edwin Odesseiron, that insulting Thayvian wizard wearing red. It is also the culmination of a very long project for me, and one that would never have been finished without the help of many different people. For more information on that, see the Credits section. I had a lot of fun writing this mod - if it gives you, the player, even a fraction of that pleasure, I will be content.

An additional optional component for the romance is a new epilogue for romanced and redeemed Viconia, of a less tragic kind than the original one. Note that this will in no way affect the Edwin romance in itself, so if you prefer Viconia's original epilogue, simply bypass this component upon installation.


## About
### Getting Started

You do need to start a new game of BGII for the Romance to start. For the Romance to run, your PC must be female, and have an Intelligence of 14 or above. You must also be human, elf, half-elf, halfling or gnome. Edwin will be found where you normally encounter him in the game, in Mae'Var's Guild, and will join your party in the normal fashion. The romance proper will only start once Mae'Var is dead. Note: For the romance to start, Edwin *must* be in your party as you kill Mae'Var.

The ToB part of the romance will start automatically, some time after you have left the Pocket Plane for the first time.

### How to Progress

Edwin will initiate conversations the same way the Bioware NPC:s do. When he does, answer him in any way you see fit. There is no need to be overly polite with him - quite the contrary, since Edwin enjoys a woman who can match him insult for insult. However, if you pick one of the seriously vicious replies (you should know them when you see them) he will terminate the relationship. If Anomen is in the party, he and Edwin will have several jealous spats over your PC. Eventually, you will have to make your choice between them. There is also an additional quest for Edwin, and if you want to romance to continue, you have to help him out with that.

Also, at one point of the game Edwin will be seriously distraught. Be supportive, but make certain he doesn't do anything rash, and all will be well.

If you have the flirt component installed, the flirts available depend on the state of the romance and, in some cases, the location your party is currently in.

### The Endings

There are three different ToB endings. One for the PC who stays with Edwin, and one for the PC who becomes a Goddess. The third and final is for non-romanced Edwin, since I personally don't care for the original one.
