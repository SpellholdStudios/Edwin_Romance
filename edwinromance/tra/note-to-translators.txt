For languages that can not be encoded in ASCII, the regular file
"setup.tra" has been split into 2 different files:

* game.tra - This file holds all strings that are displayed in the
  game and need to be encoded in the character set used by the game
  (cp1252 for western-European languages, cp1251 for Russian and
  cp1250 for Polish).

* setup.tra - Encoding should be in UTF-8 and best to use only latin letters.
