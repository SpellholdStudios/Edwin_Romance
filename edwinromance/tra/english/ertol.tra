@0    = ~The wizard may have started this journey devoted only to himself, but he has come a long way since then and shown himself prepared to sacrifice much for your sake. You know that you have affected his life deeply, for good or for ill. As you turn to him his eyes are dark and serious, as if he already knows what you are about to say.~
@1    = ~Edwin, I---~
@2    = ~No, my deva. Let me be the one to speak, here at the end of this road.~
@3    = ~I would like you to know that for me it was all worth it, the aggravation, the annoyance, even the pain and your so-called sense of humor, as long as it gave me the opportunity to stay close to you. I regret nothing. (Except possibly  meddling with the Nether Scroll, and that Icewind Dale stunt, and that one time two years ago when I tried Calimshite cooking. But apart from that, nothing.)~
@4    = ~I love you very much, with or without your soul, and when we have finished this I fully intend to demonstrate that, as long as we both survive. But should I fall in your defense, then so be it. If you have taught me anything it is that some things are worth risking everything for.~
@5    = ~Now let us go take your soul back and then see if Irenicus can cope with agonizing torture as well as dish it out. You wouldn't believe how inventive I can get when I'm feeling protective. Stuffing him into a number of his own jars sounds like a good way to start, and then we'll move on from there.~
@6    = ~Do not be preposterous, <CHARNAME>! There is no question of me departing at this time. I mean to teach this crude, leather-strap wearing jar-fetishist just what a *real* wizard is capable of, and if he should happen to have any remotely useful spells or magical artifacts at hand, I will consider them my fair payment for lending my earth-shattering magic to your service. Also... you did lend me a small, nearly insignificant amount of aid during my... unfortunate transformation, and so I have come to the conclusion that for a flea-ridden simian with barbaric manners and lacking fashion-sense, you are, perhaps... quite tolerable. You have earned the continued pleasure of my company for some time yet.~
