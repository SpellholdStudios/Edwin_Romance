# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = Edwin Romance is a Weidu mod for Baldur's Gate, Shadows of Amn, that allows the player to carry out a romantic relationship with Edwin Odesseiron, that insulting Thayvian wizard wearing red. 

An additional optional component for the romance is a new epilogue for romanced and redeemed Viconia, of a less tragic kind than the original one. Note that this will in no way affect the Edwin romance in itself, so if you prefer Viconia's original epilogue, simply bypass this component upon installation.

The mod is directly compatible with all BGII games: BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, and EET.
