          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Question: So, what's this all about, anyway?</p>

          <p>Answer: It is a Weidu mod for Baldur's Gate, Shadows of Amn, that allows the player to carry out a romantic relationship with Edwin Odesseiron, that insulting Thayvian wizard wearing red. It is also the culmination of a very long project for me, and one that would never have been finished without the help of many different people. For more information on that, see the Credits section. I had a lot of fun writing this mod - if it gives you, the player, even a fraction of that pleasure, I will be content.</p>
          <p>An additional optional component for the romance is a new epilogue for romanced and redeemed Viconia, of a less tragic kind than the original one. Note that this will in no way affect the Edwin romance in itself, so if you prefer Viconia's original epilogue, simply bypass this component upon
installation.</p>

        <!-- ================== I n s t a l l a t i o n ================== -->
        <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Installation</h2>
          <p>BGII is required. If you have ToB the full romance will be installed, otherwise only the SoA part will be installed. No fanmade mods are required, but the Edwin Romance as been tested and seems to run well with at least other Weidu mods. The mods that people have tested together with the ER include: Ascension, Redemption, The Longer Road, Solaufein, Valen, Kelsey, Tactics, Item Upgrades, Ease of Use, Dungeon-Be-Gone, NPC Banter Pack, Ashes of Embers, Unfinished Business, Tsujatha, semi multi clerics, TDDsinTDD, Corthala Romantique, the FWItem pack, G3 tweaks (some components), Hubelpot, eSeries, FR/ROV, Planar Sphere, Refinements (some components) and Improved Battles.</p>

          <p>Please note that the 'Female Edwina' component of Ease of Use may potentially cause conflict with the Edwin Romance's Female Edwina, so you
will not be able to install Edwin Romance if you have that component installed.</p>

          <p>So far incompatible: Big Picture. May be made compatible in a later version.</p>

          <p>Most likely, other Weidu mods will also work well.</p>

          <p>Edwin Romance uses the program <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/">iconv</a>, compiled for Windows by the GnuWin32 project. The iconv program is licenced under the <a href="https://gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GNU GPL</a> and comes under no warranty.</p>

          <h6>Windows</h6>
          <p>To prepare installation, extract the archive contents into your Baldur's Gate 2 folder. In a typical installation your Baldur's Gate 2 folder will be <em>'C:\Progam Files\Black Isle\BGII - SoA'</em></p>
          <p>If properly extracted, you should have an <em>'edwin'</em> folder, a <em>'setup-edwinromance.tp2'</em> file and a  <em>'setup-edwinromance.exe'</em> file in your Baldur's Gate 2 folder.</p>
          <p>To install, simply double-click <em>'setup-edwinromance.exe'</em>. Then choose which components you would like to install. You may always uninstall them later by re-running <em>'setup-edwinromance.exe'</em></p>

          <h6>Linux</h6>
          <p><b>Note:</b> The installation requires that oggdec is available on your system path. Most Linux distributions carry oggdec as part of a package called vorbis-tools.</p>
          <p>Download a compiled version of <a href="http://weidu.org/main.html#weidu">WeiDU</a> appropriate for your platform. Place the WeiDU, WeInstall and tolower binaries on your path. If you don't already have one it is recommended you create a directory in your home directory, add that directory to your path and place your binaries there. Enable the binaries to be executed as programs. You can do this by using the command <em>chmod +x WeiDU WeInstall tolower</em> in the directory you placed the files.</p>
          <p>Place the <em>edwin</em> directory and <em>setup-edwinromance.tp2</em> file in your Baldur's Gate 2 directory. Execute the tolower program in your game directory and answer yes to both questions. If you have only extracted this mod to your game directory since you last ran tolower there is no need to lower-case everything again. Additionally, you only need to generate a linux.ini file once, so there is no need to do it again if it already exists.</p>
          <p>To install the mod, use the command <em>WeInstall edwinromance</em> in your game directory. Then choose which components you would like to install. You may always uninstall them later by re-running the command.</p>

          <h6>Mac</h6>
          <p><b>Note:</b> The installation is dependent on a program called sox. A version of this program is bundled with the mod, but it will only work on a PPC Mac, or on a version of OS X that can use Rosetta to emulate a PPC environment. If you are unable to run PPC programs, you can download a version of sox compiled for Intel Macs <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">here</a>. You may also be able to obtain it from other sources. Simply replace the file edwin/sound/sox with the one you downloaded, before you run the installation.</p>
          <p>Download a compiled version of <a href="http://weidu.org/main.html#weidu">WeiDU</a> appropriate for your platform. Place the WeiDU and WeInstall binaries on your path. If you don't already have one it is recommended you create a directory in your home directory, add that directory to your path and place your binaries there. Enable the binaries to be executed as programs. You can do this by using the command <em>chmod +x WeiDU WeInstall</em> in the directory you placed the files. If you are using Wine you probably also need the tolower binary to create a linux.ini file.</p>
          <p>Place the <em>edwin</em> directory and <em>setup-edwinromance.tp2</em> file in your Baldur's Gate 2 directory. If you are using Wine, use tolower to create a linux.ini file. If you already have one there is no need to create another one.</p>
          <p>To install the mod, use the command <em>WeInstall edwinromance</em> in your game directory. Then choose which components you would like to install. You may always uninstall them later by re-running the command.</p>

        <!-- ================== About ================== -->
        <a name="about" id="about" />
        <div class="content">
          <h2>About</h2>
          <h6>Getting Started</h6>
          <p>You do need to start a new game of BGII for the Romance to start. For the Romance to run, your PC must be female, and have an Intelligence of 14 or above. You must also be human, elf, half-elf, halfling or gnome. Edwin will be found where you normally encounter him in the game, in Mae'Var's Guild, and will join your party in the normal fashion. The romance proper will only start once Mae'Var is dead. Note: For the romance to start, Edwin *must* be in your party as you kill Mae'Var.</p>
          <p>The ToB part of the romance will start automatically, some time after you have left the Pocket Plane for the first time.</p>

          <h6>How to Progress</h6>
          <p>Edwin will initiate conversations the same way the Bioware NPC:s do. When he does, answer him in any way you see fit. There is no need to be overly polite with him - quite the contrary, since Edwin enjoys a woman who can match him insult for insult. However, if you pick one of the seriously  vicious replies (you should know them when you see them) he will terminate the relationship. If Anomen is in the party, he and Edwin will have several jealous spats over your PC. Eventually, you will have to make your choice between them. There is also an additional quest for Edwin, and if you want to romance to continue, you have to help him out with that.</p>
          <p>Also, at one point of the game Edwin will be seriously distraught. Be supportive, but make certain he doesn't do anything rash, and
all will be well.</p>
          <p>If you have the flirt component installed, the flirts available depend on the state of the romance and, in some cases, the location your
party is currently in.</p>

          <h6>The Endings</h6>
          <p>There are three different ToB endings. One for the PC who stays with Edwin, and one for the PC who becomes a Goddess. The third and final is for non-romanced Edwin, since I personally don't care for the original one.</p>

        <a name="faq" id="faq"></a>
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions and Spoilers</h2>
          <p><strong>Q: I went into the Graveyard District, but Edwin doesn't mention the Nether Scroll! What's up with that?</strong><br />

            A: The Nether Scroll quest will still take place, but only when the romance has progressed far enough.<br /><br />

            When the time is right, Edwin himself will tell you, and then the quest will take place in the normal way.</p>


          <p><strong>Q: What about when Edwin is Edwina? Will there still be action between him and the PC?</strong><br />

            A: The romance dialogues will continue when Edwin is Edwina, and he has quite a lot to say about that.</p>


          <p><strong>Q: Yes, but what about Girl/Girl action, *wink wink* *nudge nudge* know what I mean?</strong><br />

            A: No. Edwina still fancies you, but is in enough gender confusion as it is.</p>


          <p><strong>Q: Oh. What if I have a *male* PC? Do I get a chance with Edwina *then*?</strong><br />

            A: I have written extra dialogues for a male PC and Edwina - try them, and see what happens.</p>


          <p><strong>Q: Do I *really* have to do Edwin's new quest?</strong><br />

            A: Yes, it is very important to him. If you take too long, he'll remind you. If you still neglect it, he'll leave.</p>


          <p><strong>Q: Edwin became a vampire - why can't I resurrect him?</strong><br />

            A: You need something else than just Bodhi's heart, and there are two possible options available. Try examining the altar again, that should tell you what you need to do.</p>


          <p><strong>Q: Are there new banters with Bioware NPC:s?</strong><br />

            A: Just a few. I have added some new commentary for Imoen when Edwin is vampirized, and both she and some other NPC:s will have brief interjections at a critical conversation in ToB. Also, banters between Edwin and Viconia, and Edwin and Mazzy, are somewhat different if you are in a romance with him. There are also some new banters between Edwin and Haer'Dalis.</p>


          <p><strong>Q: Are there banters with fanmade NPC:s?</strong><br />

            A: No, nor do I have any plans for adding them. There are simply too many to choose from, and I would not want the ones I did not ask to feel slighted.</p>


          <p><strong>Q: Degardan isn't spawning! Help!</strong><br />

            A: Degardan will only appear in certain areas, and at certain times. Here is a brief summary of those. Degardan will spawn in non-Dungeon areas. He will *not* spawn in these areas: Underdark exit (ar2500), the Docks (ar0300), Slums (ar0400), Bridge District (ar0500), Waukeen's Promenade (ar0700), Temple district (ar0900) and Government district (ar1000).<br /><br />

            So, if you want him to spawn, try going outside Athkatla for a bit, or visit the Graveyard. Presumably he is trying to avoid attracting the attention of the Cowled Wizards.<br /><br />

            Degardan will appear for the first time after you have had the lovetalk when Edwina asks you about 'this business of being female'. He will appear for the second time after the lovetalk where Edwina asks you for a certain personal item.</p>
